# Echo Language Implementation Summary

## Recent Additions (July 2024)

### 1. Emit Statement with Arguments

The `emit` statement now supports optional arguments for event emission:

```javascript
// Without arguments
emit startup;

// With single argument
emit player_moved("north");

// With multiple arguments
emit damage_taken(25, "goblin", true);

// With expressions
emit calculation_result(10 + 5, "sum");
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `EmitArgs` struct to grammar for parsing arguments
- Updated `Emit` AST variant to include optional arguments
- Grammar converter properly handles argument list
- Evaluator processes arguments and logs emission (full event system pending)

### 2. Object-Owned Event Handlers

Objects can now define event handlers as members:

```javascript
object Player {
    property health = 100;
    
    event damage_taken(amount, source) {
        this.health = this.health - amount;
        print("Took " + amount + " damage from " + source);
    }
    
    event player_moved(from, to) {
        print("Moved from " + from + " to " + to);
    }
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `EventDef` variant to `ObjectMember` in grammar
- Added `Event` variant to AST's `ObjectMember`
- Event handlers stored as object metadata (full registration pending)
- Syntax: `event name(params) { body } endevent`

### 3. Object-Owned Datalog Queries

Objects can define declarative queries using Datalog-style syntax:

```javascript
object Player {
    property location = #123;
    
    // Query with parameters
    query can_see(other_player) :-
        same_location(this, other_player),
        not(hidden(other_player)).
    
    // Query without parameters
    query accessible_exits :-
        exit_from(this.location, Exit),
        has_capability(this, UseExit(Exit)).
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `QueryDef` variant to `ObjectMember` in grammar
- Created query-specific types: `QueryParams`, `QueryParam`, `QueryClause`
- Horn clause syntax with `:-` operator
- Query parameters and clauses properly parsed
- Queries stored as object metadata (Datalog engine pending)

## Grammar Structure

### Statement vs Expression Separation

The improved grammar (grammar_improved.rs) implements clear separation between statements and expressions, following MOO's CST structure:

- **Statements**: Control flow, declarations, assignments that cannot be used as values
- **Expressions**: Values that can be used in other expressions

This separation resolves the "in" keyword conflict between the binary operator and for-loop syntax.

## Testing

All features have been tested with:
- Unit tests for grammar parsing
- Integration tests for evaluation
- Example files demonstrating usage

## Next Steps

1. **Event System Implementation**
   - Create event registry and subscription mechanism
   - Implement event bubbling/propagation
   - Add event handler execution

2. **Datalog Engine**
   - Implement Horn clause evaluation
   - Add fact database
   - Query execution and result binding

3. **Improved Grammar Integration**
   - Fix remaining rust_sitter compilation issues
   - Fully integrate improved grammar with statement/expression separation
   - Add comprehensive test suite

## File Organization

- `src/parser/echo/grammar.rs` - Main grammar with all new features
- `src/parser/echo/grammar_improved.rs` - Improved grammar with statement/expression separation
- `src/ast/mod.rs` - Unified AST supporting all features
- `src/evaluator/mod.rs` - Evaluator with event emission support
- Test files: `test_emit_*.echo`, `test_object_event.echo`, `test_object_query.echo`
