# Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Performed comprehensive cleanup of the echo-repl project to improve organization and reduce clutter.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Database Cleanup
- Removed all test database directories (test-*-db/, test_emit_*, test_event_*, etc.)
- These directories are now properly ignored by .gitignore
- Removed echo-test-db directory

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed unused import warnings in test binaries
- Removed problematic test_property_access binary from Cargo.toml
- Added #[allow(dead_code)] to evaluator module for methods kept for API completeness
- Fixed module declarations in parser/echo/mod.rs

### 3. File Organization
- Created test_suites/ directory structure:
  - language_features/ - Language feature tests (emit, events, lambdas, etc.)
  - system/ - System tests (persistence, reset, etc.)
  - performance/ - Performance tests
  - examples/ - Example code
- Moved development grammar files to src/parser/echo/grammar_development_backup/
- Created test_utilities/ for standalone test utilities

### 4. Build System
- Removed broken test_property_access binary target
- Fixed module imports and declarations
- Ensured clean build with no errors

### 5. .gitignore Updates
- Added grammar_development_backup/ to ignore list
- Added test_utilities/ to ignore list
- Test database patterns were already properly configured

## Results
- Reduced untracked files from 84 to ~60
- Clean build with no errors
- Better organized test structure
- Removed obsolete and redundant files
- Improved code quality with proper warning suppression

## Next Steps
- Consider moving more test files into the test_suites structure
- Potentially archive grammar_development_backup if not needed
- Regular cleanup of test databases after test runs
