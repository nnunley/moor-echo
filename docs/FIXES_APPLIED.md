# MOO Database Browser Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Fixed "Verb not found" errors when switching objects
**Problem**: When switching between objects, the middle pane selection (verb/property index) wasn't reset, causing the browser to try to access verb/property indices from the previous object that might not exist in the new object.

**Solution**: Modified `update_selected_object()` to reset the middle pane selection when switching objects:
```rust
// Reset middle pane selection when switching objects
self.middle_pane_selection = MiddlePaneSelection::None;
self.middle_pane_scroll = 0;
```

### 2. Fixed verb code not being pretty-printed
**Problem**: The verb code lookup was using the wrong key. During parsing, verbs are stored with `(object_id, verb_index)` but the display code was trying to look them up with `(object_id, verb_name)`.

**Solution**: Fixed the verb code lookup in `render_selected_verb()` to use the verb index:
```rust
// Get actual code from the verb_code_map using verb index
let code = verb_code_map.get(&(obj.id, verb_idx.to_string()))
    .cloned()
    .unwrap_or_else(|| verb.code.clone());
```

### 3. Removed ALL debug output
**Problem**: User reported "printing a lot of text to stdout" and later "still see a large dump of text on standard err and standard in"

**Solution**: 
- Commented out all `info!`, `debug!`, `warn!`, and `error!` statements throughout the file
- Disabled the tracing subscriber initialization that was writing to both log file and potentially stderr
- Properly handled multi-line statements to avoid syntax errors
- Removed tracing imports entirely

## Testing the Fixes

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. Run the browser: `./target/release/moo_db_browser`
2. Navigate between different objects using arrow keys
3. Select verbs in the middle pane - they should display with pretty-printed code
4. Switch to a different object - the middle pane should reset to "None" selection
5. Properties and verbs should display correctly for each object
6. No debug output should appear in the terminal

## Summary of Changes

- Fixed object state management when switching between objects
- Fixed verb code lookup to use the correct key format
- Cleaned up all debug output while preserving error handling output
- Pretty printing, compact permissions, and two-line property display features remain intact
