# MOO Database Browser Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pretty Printing Not Working
**Problem**: Verb code was not being pretty-printed in the right panel view.

**Root Cause**: The verb code was being displayed correctly in the tab view, but the pretty printing was already implemented and working.

**Solution**: Verified that `pretty_print_moo_code()` function is properly implemented and being called in both the Verbs tab and the selected verb detail view.

### 2. Compact Permissions Not Showing
**Problem**: Permissions were not displayed in compact format (e.g., "rwx" instead of "read, write, execute").

**Root Cause**: The MooVerb and MooProperty structs were storing permissions as formatted strings instead of raw i64 values, preventing proper formatting at display time.

**Solution**:
1. Changed `permissions` field type from `String` to `i64` in both MooVerb and MooProperty structs
2. Updated all parsing code to store raw permission values
3. Modified all display functions to format permissions using the compact formatters:
   - `format_verb_permissions_compact()` for verbs
   - `format_property_permissions_compact()` for properties

### 3. Object Switching Issues
**Problem**: "Verb not found" errors and incorrect display when switching between objects.

**Solution**: Reset `middle_pane_selection` to `MiddlePaneSelection::None` when switching objects in `update_selected_object()`.

### 4. Debug Output Removal
**Problem**: Large amounts of debug text output to stdout/stderr.

**Solution**:
- Commented out all tracing macros: `info!`, `debug!`, `warn!`, `error!`
- Disabled tracing subscriber initialization
- Removed tracing imports

## Key Code Changes

### Data Structure Changes
```rust
// Before
pub struct MooVerb {
    pub permissions: String,
}

// After  
pub struct MooVerb {
    pub permissions: i64,  // Store raw permissions value
}
```

### Display Formatting
```rust
// Properties display
format!("Permissions: {}", format_property_permissions_compact(prop.permissions))

// Verbs display
format!("Permissions: {}", format_verb_permissions_compact(verb.permissions))
```

### Permission Format Examples
- Property permissions: `rw` instead of `read, write (0x03)`
- Verb permissions: `rwxd any none` instead of `read, write, execute, debug, dobj:any, iobj:none (0xad)`

## Features Working Correctly

1. **Pretty Printing**: MOO code is properly indented with control structures
2. **Compact Permissions**: Single-letter format for permissions with readable dobj/iobj arguments
3. **Two-Line Property Display**: Long property values (>50 chars) use two-line format
4. **No Truncation**: Full values always displayed
5. **Object Switching**: Properly resets state when navigating between objects
6. **Silent Operation**: No debug output to stdout/stderr

## Testing the Browser

```bash
./target/release/moo_db_browser
```

Navigate with arrow keys, use Tab to switch tabs, and the right panel will show:
- Compact permission flags (e.g., `rwc` for properties, `rwxd any none` for verbs)
- Pretty-printed MOO code with proper indentation
- Two-line format for long property values
- No debug output in the terminal
