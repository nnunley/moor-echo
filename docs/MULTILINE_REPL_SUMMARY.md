# Multi-line REPL Support Summary

## What Was Implemented

We now have automatic multi-line detection in the REPL that doesn't require
`.eval` mode for simple multi-line constructs.

### Working Multi-line Constructs

✅ **While Loops**

```echo
while (i < 3)
  i = i + 1
endwhile
```

✅ **For Loops**

```echo
for x in ({1, 2, 3})
  sum = sum + x
endfor
```

✅ **Object Definitions**

```echo
object hello
  property greeting = "Hello"
endobject
```

✅ **Simple Block Functions** (without nested constructs)

```echo
let mul = fn {x, y}
  x * y
endfn
```

✅ **If Statements** (without nested constructs)

```echo
if (x > 0)
  "positive"
else
  "negative"
endif
```

### Implementation Details

1. **Multi-line Collector**: Detects construct starts (`while`, `for`, `if`,
   `fn`, `object`)
2. **Depth Tracking**: Tracks nesting depth to handle constructs within
   constructs
3. **Automatic Prompt**: Changes from `>>` to `..` when collecting lines
4. **Ctrl+C Support**: Can cancel multi-line input with Ctrl+C

### Limitations

⚠️ **Nested Block Functions**: Functions with control flow inside still need
`.eval` mode:

```echo
.eval
let factorial = fn {n}
  if (n <= 1)
    1
  else
    n * factorial(n - 1)
  endif
endfn
.
```

This is because the parser's `parse_program` method tries to parse each line
separately, which doesn't work well with deeply nested constructs.

## Usage

The REPL now provides two ways to enter multi-line code:

1. **Automatic Detection** (NEW): Just type multi-line constructs naturally
   - The REPL detects construct starts and waits for end markers
   - Shows `..` prompt while collecting lines
   - Works for most common constructs

2. **Explicit .eval Mode**: For complex nested constructs
   - Enter `.eval` to start multi-line mode
   - Type multiple lines/statements
   - End with `.` on its own line
   - Required for nested functions with control flow

## Benefits

- More natural MOO-like REPL experience
- No need for `.eval` for simple multi-line constructs
- Visual feedback with prompt change (`>>` → `..`)
- Maintains compatibility with existing `.eval` mode

## Technical Notes

- Uses existing parser infrastructure (no grammar changes)
- Comments are automatically passed through
- Empty lines within constructs are preserved
- Supports Ctrl+C to cancel multi-line input
